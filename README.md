# Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym
OpenAi Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It allows to create new environments or reuse their preset ones.

* `openai_pendulum.py` has a Q-Learning implementation using OpenAi Gym platform.
* `external_pendulum.py` has a Q-Learning implementation using a custom Pendulum.
* `plot.py` contains code for timing comparison.
